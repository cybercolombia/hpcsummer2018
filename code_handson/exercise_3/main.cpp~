/*
 * Create a small library to compute the area of some 
 * geometric figures.
 * The first function "c_area" recieves a raius and returns the area of the circle.
 * The second "s_area" recieves the leght of a side and returns the area of the square.
 * The third "t_area" recieves heigh and base of a riangle and returns its area.
 * 
 * The prototypes of the functions should be in a file called "geometric.hpp"
 * while the implementations go in a file called "geometric.cpp"
