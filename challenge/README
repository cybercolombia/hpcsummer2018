The challenge consists in solving the Freedman's Paradox. Please refer to the following article,

For a detailed explanation on the Multilinear regression model and considerations please refer to:

Also check docs/mlr.pdf for other details.

Please follow these steps to solve the challenge:

1. Create the "X" matrix for each sample of dimensions 128x512 (See we have picked multiples of 32 for each dimension. Guess why?)
2. Create the "Y" vector as a matrix with dimensions 128x1.
3. Find $\hat{Beta}$
